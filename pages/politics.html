        <p>Sen. John Thune agonized over running for re-election after <strong>clashing with former President Donald Trump</strong>, and now a conservative group is polling South Dakota Republicans in a bid to gin up a primary challenger.<br><br>
        Within 48 hours of Thune, R-S.D., announcing his re-election campaign Saturday, the American Potential Fund began polling the state's likely GOP voters. The survey determined Thune could lose a primary by 9 percentage points to <strong>Gov. Kristi Noem</strong> and could face a spirited challenge from Dusty Johnson, South Dakota’s lesser-known U.S. representative, according to a polling memo, obtained by NBC News, that the political committee circulated to donors and political insiders Thursday.<br><br>
        The South Dakota survey — conducted by one of Trump’s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio — is the latest salvo in the ongoing effort by some in the GOP to <strong>purge the party of those seen as insufficiently loyal to the former president</strong>. Trump and his allies have successfully encouraged primary challenges to Republican incumbents in states such as Georgia, Wyoming, Michigan and Ohio, particularly targeting members of Congress who voted with Democrats to impeach or convict the former president over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.<br><br>
